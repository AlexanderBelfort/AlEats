��# AlEats

**AlEats** is a small, quick project for ordering food. It is extremely similar to an older UberEats version. JS is **not** implemented, so if we were to speak about the funtionality, this website is extremely restricted with a 404 back-end. It's more of a UI remix.

The lack of functionality is masked with the css overflow however.

ParcelJS was also used for the creation of this application.
